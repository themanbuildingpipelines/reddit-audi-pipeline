## Why this project
![2020-audi-s5-sportback-311-1588268368](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c69ded4b-4009-469b-86ec-56050a4e29da)
I have been an Audi fan for years now. I picture myself speeding with my Audi S5 to wherever the road takes me. 
That aside, I'm in most of Audi subreddits and thought, why not create a project where I get to analyze
what Audi cars are most loves, common issues with Audis, mods that are popular in the community, etc.

## By the end of this project, I should be able to...
1. Track patterns in upvotes, comments, and posting activity (e.g., which models get the most community attention).
2. Identify common issues, popular modifications, and recurring themes in the Audi community.
3. Compare mentions and engagement across Audi A4, A6, Q5, S5, R8, etc.
4. Track patterns in upvotes, comments, and posting activity (e.g., which models get the most community attention).
